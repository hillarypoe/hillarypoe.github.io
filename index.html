                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in a small rural town surrounded by the beauty of horse farms and in the heart of Bourbon country. I have spent the last 9 years as a nurse working in areas with some of the most cricitally ill patients and currently work as a Nurse Case Manager giving my patients every opportunity to thrive outside of the hospital setting.
                     <br> When I am not working, I have the joy of being a wife and mom to an amazing 4 year that has always inspired me to be passionate and creative which is a huge push for me to start my coding journey and allowing a separate form of creativity come to fruition.</p>
